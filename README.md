# JS Tiles

Small utility to convert geojson (oklahoma census tracts) to a directory of vector tiles. It uses [geojson-vt](https://github.com/mapbox/geojson-vt) and it was pretty fun to build.

## Running

* `npm install`
* `node index.js`

After it runs, you should have a zyx tile directory named 'ok-census-tracts'.
